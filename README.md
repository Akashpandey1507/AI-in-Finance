# AI-in-Finance

📌 Phase 1: Build a Stronger Foundation in Python & Finance for AI Integration (1-2 Months)
This phase will solidify your Python skills for finance and introduce AI-powered tools for research.

1. Python for Financial Analysis
Since you're already familiar with Python, let's build on that:

✅ Review Data Analysis Basics

Pandas: Master handling and cleaning financial datasets.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Create visualizations for financial data (e.g., stock price trends, correlation of ratios).
NumPy: Understand financial metrics like ROI, CAGR, and other time-series analysis.
📚 Resources:

“Python for Finance” by Yves Hilpisch
Coursera: Python for Data Science (Quick recap).
Kaggle: Finance Datasets for practice.
🔥 Practical Task:

Create a Python script that imports stock data (from Yahoo Finance) and visualizes historical price trends and correlations.
Write a simple DCF model in Python, focusing on building the NPV calculations and cash flow projections.
2. Python-Driven Valuation Models (Focus on Automating DCF and Comps)
The goal is to automate your valuation models to use AI efficiently.

✅ Create DCF and Comps Models in Python

Automate the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Comparable Company Analysis (Comps) models using Python.
Use Pandas DataFrames to handle financial data for DCF (e.g., cash flows, discount rates, terminal value).
Integrate Excel for large-scale modeling and analysis.
📚 Resources:

Udemy: Financial Modeling in Python
Real financial statements from Yahoo Finance API for Comps data.
🔥 Practical Task:

Automate company DCF (e.g., Zomato or Polycab).
Use Comps (price-to-earnings, price-to-sales) to create a relative valuation model.
3. Start Using AI-Powered Tools for Financial Research
Now, let’s integrate AI tools that will amplify your research. Start simple and gradually build your expertise.

✅ Use DeepSeek for Financial Research

DeepSeek Finance will assist you in quickly summarizing annual reports, investor presentations, and earnings calls.
Use it for industry analysis and sector-based trends.
✅ Integrate Google LLM & ChatGPT for Real-Time Insights

Use Google LLM (or ChatGPT) to pull market sentiment or news analysis to understand how macro trends impact valuation.
Use ChatGPT to generate insights from financial statements (e.g., summarize P&L data, extract key ratios, etc.).
📚 Resources:

DeepSeek Finance (Free version for research).
ChatGPT (for quick insights and financial models).
Google LLM (for understanding global finance trends).
🔥 Practical Task:

Analyze 2 companies using DeepSeek to extract key financial insights (growth, profitability, risks).
Use ChatGPT to summarize 1 annual report and generate a quick valuation based on the data extracted.
📌 Phase 2: Dive Deeper into Python Automation for Finance (1-2 Months)
Now, we dive deeper into using Python and AI to automate your workflow.

1. Data Automation & Financial APIs
By this stage, you should be comfortable with Python and should focus on automating data collection and integration.

✅ Learn to Work with Financial APIs

Yahoo Finance API: Get stock prices, historical data, and financial ratios.
Alpha Vantage API: Get economic indicators, stock market data, and financial statements.
📚 Resources:

Udemy: API Basics with Python
Official API Documentation: Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage API.
🔥 Practical Task:

Build an automated Python script that uses Yahoo Finance API to download historical stock data and create visuals like moving averages or price trends.
Integrate data into your valuation models (DCF, Comps) and track performance over time.
2. Automate Valuation with AI Tools & Python
This will focus on building AI-powered financial tools to assist with valuation.

✅ Use AI for Financial Forecasting

Use machine learning models to predict stock prices, cash flows, or valuation multiples.
Use linear regression for revenue forecasting and decision trees for risk analysis.
📚 Resources:

Kaggle: Find datasets and projects related to stock price prediction.
Scikit-Learn (Python library) for machine learning.
🔥 Practical Task:

Build a linear regression model that predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
Integrate AI forecasting into your DCF models for a more data-driven approach.
📌 Phase 3: AI Agents & Automation (3-4 Months)
This phase will be advanced: building AI agents for deep financial analysis and integrating them into your workflow.

1. Learn About AI Agents (LangChain, AutoGPT)
These tools will automate specific financial tasks and create a fully integrated AI-driven finance workflow.

✅ Build an AI-powered Stock Analysis Agent

Use LangChain or AutoGPT to create an AI chatbot that can perform valuation tasks, analyze earnings reports, and compare historical data.
📚 Resources:

LangChain & AutoGPT Documentation
GitHub Repositories on financial AI bots.
🔥 Practical Task:

Build a LangChain-powered assistant that answers stock-related questions and can generate quick valuation estimates based on financial data.
📌 Phase 4: Develop Your AI-Driven Finance Portfolio (Ongoing)
Once you’re comfortable, your focus should be on applying all these tools together and monetizing your skills.

✅ Launch an AI-Powered Research Service

Start creating AI-enhanced valuation reports for clients.
Create a YouTube channel or blog (like TRF with Akash) that focuses on AI in finance, showcasing how AI models and automation can enhance valuation processes.
✅ Explore AI in Financial Markets

Create AI-powered trading models or investment strategies.
Continue integrating Python, AI, and financial theory for better decision-making.
🚀 Final Takeaway: The Roadmap to Success
Phase 1: Strengthen your Python skills and integrate AI tools like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.
Phase 2: Automate financial data analysis and integrate APIs (Yahoo, Alpha Vantage).
Phase 3: Build AI agents to automate valuation models and use machine learning for forecasting.
Phase 4: Monetize your skills through research reports and AI-driven finance products.
